## Project Brief

📝 The PingResponder project is a Java-based implementation that enables network administrators to monitor and manage network devices efficiently. The `PingResponder` Java file is designed to listen on a specified port and respond to incoming ping requests with website URLs. The code uses Java libraries to create a UDP datagram packet and a TCP socket to send and receive ping and URL requests, respectively.. 👨‍💻

🔧The project code is written in Java and can be executed using a command-line interface. The `PingResponder` class implements the `Runnable` interface and can be used to create a new thread that listens for incoming ping requests. The code uses the `ServerSocket` and `Socket` classes to accept incoming connections and receive data from client devices.📡

🛠️The PingResponder project also includes a `PingSender` class that defines methods for sending ping requests and website URLs. The code uses the `DatagramPacket` class to construct a ping request packet and the `PrintWriter` class to send an HTTP GET request for the specified URL. 🔍

## Skills Acquired

- Proficiency in Java programming language
- Understanding of socket programming concepts in Java
- Familiarity with UDP and TCP protocols
- Knowledge of network monitoring and management principles
- Experience in using Notepad++ software for Java programming
- Knowledge of Tomcat server and JAR file creation and deployment

## Project Summary

The PingResponder project is a Java-based implementation for network monitoring and management. The project code uses Java libraries to implement a ping responder that listens for incoming ping requests and responds with website URLs. The project includes a `PingSender` class that defines methods for sending ping requests and website URLs.

The project code was written in Notepad++ software and compiled using the `javac` command. The compiled class file was then deployed to Tomcat server by copying it to `tomcat/lib` directory. The project was tested by restarting the Catalina server and opening the localhost port `8080`. A `wifiTunnel` was created to allow all TCP requests on port `8080`, and the project was tested by pinging 10 different IP addresses and sending a domain over socket exchange.

Overall, the PingResponder project provides a comprehensive solution for network monitoring and management, and the code can be customized and extended to meet specific requirements.
